# myly - Lyrics app
> check it here: [myly ](https://myly-lyrics-app.herokuapp.com/)

myly is a Website to write and store your original lyrics, share them with the world and explore what other people are writing. You can organize your Lyrics by colourful tags that express it's mood and you can write notes about your creation process, ideas and what else you think is helpful for you and others to understand it in a deeper way.
It is just at it's beginning as I plan to maintain it, upgrade it and improve it constantly. 

This is the first app I made by myself after finishing my **Full-Stack Development** bootcamp by **LeWagon**. My plan when developing this project is to make a ready-to-use Website and to challenge and improve my CSS skills, since until then I focused more on understanding the Web architecture and structure.

For this application my idea was to have a simple Database to work with and to display it in a fun, dynamic way. I enjoyed the fun theme to explore a a bit with animations.  I also wanted to get rid of my paper mess from the lyrics I write as a hobbyist musician ASAP.

My biggest challenge was understanding how to place the pieces together with CSS: using grid, flexbox, margins, etc. I spent some time figuring out pseudo-classes, selectors as :nth_of_type() and so on. I started doing this project lacking a lot of knowledge and having to fix my own errors was interesting, because I could notice the growth of my comprehension about multiple aspects of the stack I used.
