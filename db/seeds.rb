    I touch on you more and more every time
    When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
    Call your name two, three times in a row
    Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
    How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
    'Cause I know I don't understand
    Just how your love can do what no one else can
    Got me looking so crazy right now, your love's

    Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
    If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
    It's the way that you know what I thought I knew

    Tropical the island breeze   
    All of nature wild and free  
    This is where I long to be  
    La isla bonita

    The sun would set so high  
    Ring through my ears and sting my eyes

    Te dijo te amo  
    I prayed that the days would last  
    They went so fast

    This is where I long to be

    And when the samba played  
    The sun would set so high  
    Ring through my ears and sting my eyes  
    Your Spanish lullaby  
     
    I want to be where the sun warms the sky  
    When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by  
    Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
